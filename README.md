Pulsar Classification: Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier Project with Pulsar Dataset
# In this project, the goal is to classify pulsar stars using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The dataset used in this project is the Pulsar dataset, which contains features derived from pulsar candidates and non-pulsar sources collected from the High Time Resolution Universe Survey. The objective is to develop an SVM classifier that can accurately differentiate between pulsar and non-pulsar instances based on the given features.By utilizing an SVM classifier on the Pulsar dataset, this project aims to accurately classify pulsar and non-pulsar instances. The results can contribute to the identification of potential pulsar candidates and aid in further scientific exploration and understanding of these celestial objects.
